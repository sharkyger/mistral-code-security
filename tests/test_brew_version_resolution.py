"""Brew version resolution — the gate must not block the version that FIXES a CVE.

`resolve_latest_version()` handled pip and npm only; for brew it returned None
and the caller then checked the formula against its ENTIRE CVE history, so any
formula that ever had an advisory came back vulnerable at every version. The
reported case: `brew install gitleaks` refused because of CVE-2026-63728
("Gitleaks prior to 8.30.1 ..."), at Homebrew's stable 8.30.1 — the release
carrying the fix.

Fully mocked: no network, no Homebrew binary needed.
